<!-- The idea of this project is to make a portfolio so that everyone can see my work, get to know me a little bit and also so they can contact me.
It will be aimed at human resources people and the general public. The idea is to get work and also to show the progress from my first web page to the present. It should reflect the progress of the knowledge acquired, not just the skill.-->
